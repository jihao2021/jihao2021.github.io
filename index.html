        <h2>Self Introduction</h2>
        <p>Yuke Li received her Bachelor’s degree in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics from Peking University in 2011, followed by a Ph.D. degree in Political Science from Yale University in 2018. She has since pursued postdoctoral training at Yale Department of Electrical Engineering on a US Army Research Office grant (2019) and at the Westlake Institute for Advanced Study during the pandemic. Her research interests are in  two main areas: game theory, multi-agent systems, and their applications in international relations, as well as Chinese foreign policy. She has published her work in top venues, including Automatica, Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation, and the World Economic Forum Agenda. In her free time, she collaborates with the team of Yang Lan, China's renowned television host and ambassador for Beijing's bid for the 2008 Olympic Games, organizing dialogues among distinguished figures from academia, business, and politics to promote mutual understanding between China and the rest of the world. After the pandemic, she visited the Oxford China Center and is currently at Yale University.
